# YouGo
Welcome! This repo hosts project descriptions for the YouGo mentorship group, backend path.

## Things to note
- This is a living document that will get updated as processes and projects evolve.
- You can attempt each project in any language of your choice, however the languages for which I can commit support are: Go, Python, Node. If other mentors commit to other languages, I'll update here.
- Speaking of support, while anyone is welcome to attempt these projects, I only provide support on the group's discord server.
  - *If you open an issue on this repo or DM me on twitter, I will most likely close/ignore it.* Not trying to be rude, but I'm volunteering my time, so I have to channel it. Thanks for your understanding. ðŸ™‚
- For most projects, I'll post the project piecewise and notify the group when the new part is released. Don't take this as a due date for the previous part. The main reasons for doing it this way:
  - Time. While I usually have a more-or-less complete idea of the project, doing the write-up of the spec takes time so it's portioned.
  - Real life simulation. As a developer, you don't always have a clear idea of how the requirements for a project will grow or change. Some of the later parts of projects will be easier or harder based on design decisions made in the earlier parts.

## Who/what skill level is this for

These projects are not about teaching you to code. While I assume you're new to the field, I also assume you have decent mastery of a language and can now tackle higher order problems such as design and integration.
